# Country and Capital Geography
Data science project using scraped data for visualizing database queries 

- Data scraped from http://techslides.com/list-of-countries-and-capitals and saved to JSON. 
- The data included area in square miles, ratio of coast to area as coastline, birth/death-rates, infant-mortality rates, literacy rates, and phone access rates. 
- The data was put into dataframes and several summary figures are in the Country_Captial_Geography.ipynb file
- The dataframes were then dumped into a SQLite database and similar summary questions were answered using SQL.
- The rest of the project was visualizing those queries.
